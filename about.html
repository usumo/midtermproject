            <p>
                I'm a weird person who loves eating and playing pool. People often say I'm lazy and a bit too optimistic. I'm also interested in technology and theater.

                I enjoy coding (not really but I hope to improve my skills enough to make it interesting LOL), watching movies and playing pool, especially pool where I can get a good brain workout by managing to think of how to solve the shape and clear the table as clean as possible.

            <p>
                One kind of sports that I put a lot of my effort into perfecting is Pool (or Billiards), a game where you get a stick and poke balls (literally). Pool and Golf are in the same category called "cue sports", where you hit a ball with a cue and try to win by a set of rules. Pool is a game of skill and strategy, where you have to think carefully about your moves and how to win the game. And the reason why Pool is not widely welcomed might originate from the fact that it has a long history connected to betting and gambling, which is not a good way to spend your time. But in reality, Pool is a fun and challenging sport that requires a lot of patience and concentration, put the gambling aside you can see it is just another sports, and it takes significantly more time than other sports to master. I hope in the future more people would know about Pool and try it out, and to grow our Pool community, make it a better sports.
